    What is a **VPC** and what are its core components?
  Back: |
    A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is an isolated virtual network within AWS where you launch resources. It gives you full control over IP addressing, subnets, routing, and access control -- like a private data center in the cloud.

    **Core components:**
    - **Subnets:** Divide the VPC into segments, each in a specific Availability Zone. Can be public or private.
    - **Route tables:** Control where network traffic is directed. Each subnet is associated with a route table.
    - **Internet gateway:** Connects the VPC to the public internet. Public subnets route traffic through it.
    - **NAT gateway:** Lets resources in private subnets access the internet (for updates, API calls) without being publicly reachable from the internet.
    - **Security groups:** Stateful firewalls attached to individual resources (EC2 instances, RDS databases).
    - **Network ACLs:** Stateless firewalls at the subnet level for defense-in-depth.

    **Interview tip:** When designing an AWS architecture, start by sketching the VPC. It is the foundation -- subnets determine what is public, what is private, and how traffic flows.

    What is the difference between a **security group** and a **network ACL**?
  Back: |
    Both filter network traffic, but they operate at different levels and with different behavior.

    **Security groups (instance-level, stateful):**
    - Attached to ENIs (network interfaces) on individual resources
    - **Stateful:** If inbound traffic is allowed, the outbound response is automatically allowed (and vice versa)
    - Default: deny all inbound, allow all outbound
    - Rules are allow-only -- you cannot create explicit deny rules
    - Evaluated as a whole: if any rule allows the traffic, it passes

    **Network ACLs (subnet-level, stateless):**
    - Applied to all traffic entering or leaving a subnet
    - **Stateless:** Inbound and outbound rules are evaluated independently. You must explicitly allow both the request and the response.
    - Default: allow all inbound and outbound
    - Rules can be allow or deny, evaluated in order by rule number

    **In practice:** Security groups are the primary access control tool. NACLs are a defense-in-depth layer -- most teams set them up once and rarely change them. The critical distinction is **stateful vs stateless**.

    **Interview tip:** If asked about VPC security, mention both layers. Explain that security groups handle most access control, and NACLs provide an additional subnet-level boundary.

    What is **IAM** and what is the principle of least privilege?
  Back: |
    IAM (Identity and Access Management) controls **who** can do **what** on **which resources** in your AWS account.

    **Core concepts:**
    - **Users:** Individual human identities with credentials
    - **Groups:** Collections of users sharing the same permissions
    - **Roles:** Temporary identities assumed by services or users. A Lambda function assumes a role to access S3 -- it does not have permanent credentials.
    - **Policies:** JSON documents defining permissions. Each policy specifies an Effect (Allow/Deny), Action (e.g., `s3:GetObject`), and Resource (e.g., a specific S3 bucket ARN).

    **Principle of least privilege:** Grant only the minimum permissions needed for a task. A Lambda function that reads from one S3 bucket should have a policy allowing `s3:GetObject` on that specific bucket -- not `s3:*` on `*`.

    **Common mistake:** Using overly broad policies like `"Action": "*", "Resource": "*"` during development and never tightening them for production. This turns a single compromised service into a full account breach.

    **Interview tip:** Mention IAM roles over access keys. Roles are temporary and automatically rotated -- hardcoded access keys are a security liability.

  tags: ["aws", "networking", "subnets", "VPC"]
  Front: |
    What is the difference between a **public** and **private** subnet?
  Back: |
    The distinction comes down to one thing: whether the subnet's route table has a route to an **internet gateway**.

    **Public subnet:**
    - Route table includes a route to an internet gateway (e.g., `0.0.0.0/0 -> igw-xxx`)
    - Resources can have public IP addresses and are reachable from the internet
    - Used for: load balancers, bastion hosts, NAT gateways

    **Private subnet:**
    - No route to an internet gateway
    - Resources are only reachable from within the VPC
    - For outbound internet access (software updates, API calls), traffic routes through a **NAT gateway** in a public subnet
    - Used for: application servers, databases, internal services

    **Standard architecture pattern:**
    - Load balancers in public subnets (accept traffic from the internet)
    - Application servers in private subnets (only reachable from the load balancer)
    - Databases in private subnets (only reachable from application servers)

    This layered approach is the foundation of a secure AWS architecture. Each tier can only communicate with its adjacent tiers.

    **Interview tip:** When sketching an AWS architecture, always place databases and application servers in private subnets. Placing a database in a public subnet is a common red flag in design reviews.
