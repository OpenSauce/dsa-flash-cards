    Which data structure …

    - Stores **unique elements only**
    - Provides **add / remove / contains** in **O(1)** average time
    - Is often implemented as a hash table without values?

    What data structure operation does this implement? What is its time complexity?

    ```go
    _, ok := s[x]
    ```

    Contains / membership test (O(1) average)

    Go's map lookup returns a second boolean indicating presence. This is the core advantage of a set — constant-time membership testing that avoids the O(n) scan of a list.
