    Which data structure …

    - Operates on a **first-in, first-out** principle
    - Uses **enqueue** at the rear and **dequeue** at the front
    - Is common in task scheduling, buffering, and BFS

    What data structure operation does this implement? What is its time complexity?

    ```go
    found := false
    target := 3
    for _, v := range q {
        if v == target { found = true; break }
    }
    ```

    Linear search (O(n))

    Queues don't support random access, so finding an element requires scanning from front to back. If fast lookup is needed, maintain a parallel set.
