    Which graph traversal …

    - Uses a **queue** to visit nodes level by level
    - Finds shortest path in **unweighted** graphs
    - Runs in **O(V+E)** time?

    What graph traversal algorithm is this? What is its time and space complexity?

    ```go
    q := []int{start}
    dist := map[int]int{start: 0}
    for len(q) > 0 {
        v := q[0]; q = q[1:]
        for _, nb := range g[v] {
            if _, seen := dist[nb]; !seen {
                dist[nb] = dist[v] + 1
                q = append(q, nb)
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    BFS traversal (O(V+E))

    Visits all nodes at distance d before any at distance d+1. The `dist` map doubles as a visited set — using it instead of a separate `visited` boolean also gives you shortest-path distances for free.
