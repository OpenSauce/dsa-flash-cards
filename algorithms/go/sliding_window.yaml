    - Maintains a **window** (contiguous subarray or substring)
    - Slides it left/right to process data in **O(n)**, updating state incrementally?

    **Sliding Window**

    A technique that maintains a window over a contiguous subarray or substring and slides it across the input, updating state incrementally in O(n). Use for problems involving contiguous sequences -- max sum subarray, longest substring without repeats, minimum window containing a target. Trade-off: only works on contiguous ranges; non-contiguous subset problems require other approaches like dynamic programming.

    What algorithm technique is this? What problem does it solve?

    ```go
    sum, best := 0, -1<<31
    for i, v := range a {
        sum += v
        if i >= k { sum -= a[i-k] }
        if i >= k-1 && sum > best { best = sum }
    }
    ```

    Fixed-size sliding window – O(n)

    Avoids recomputing the sum from scratch each time by adding the new element and subtracting the one that left the window. This "add one, remove one" pattern turns an O(nk) brute force into O(n).
