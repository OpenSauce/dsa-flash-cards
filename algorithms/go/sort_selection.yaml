    Which sorting algorithm …

    - Repeatedly selects the **minimum** remaining element
    - Swaps it into the correct position
    - Always runs in **O(n²)** time?

    What sorting algorithm is this? What is its time and space complexity?

    ```go
    for i := 0; i < n-1; i++ {
        min := i
        for j := i + 1; j < n; j++ {
            if a[j] < a[min] { min = j }
        }
        a[i], a[min] = a[min], a[i]
    }
    ```

    Selection Sort (O(n²) time, O(1) space)

    Always performs n(n−1)/2 comparisons regardless of input order — no best‑case shortcut. Useful when writes are expensive since it does at most n swaps, but insertion sort is generally preferred.
