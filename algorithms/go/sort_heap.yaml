    Which sorting algorithm …

    - Builds a **binary heap** then repeatedly extracts max/min
    - Runs in **O(n log n)** time
    - Sorts **in-place** with `O(1)` extra memory?

    What sorting algorithm is this? What is its time and space complexity?

    ```go
    heapify(a)                // O(n)
    for end := n-1; end > 0; end-- {
        a[0], a[end] = a[end], a[0]
        siftDown(a, 0, end)   // O(log n)
    }
    ```

    Heap Sort (O(n log n) time, O(1) space)

    Guaranteed O(n log n) with no extra memory — combines the best of merge sort's time guarantee and quicksort's space efficiency. Not stable and poor cache locality make it slower in practice than quicksort.
