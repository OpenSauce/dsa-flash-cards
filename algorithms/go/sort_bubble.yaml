    Which sorting algorithm …

    - Repeatedly swaps **adjacent** out-of-order elements
    - Has worst-case **O(n²)** time
    - Is often taught first for its simplicity?

    What sorting algorithm is this? What is its time and space complexity?

    ```go
    for i := 0; i < n-1; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < n-1-i; j++ {
            if a[j] > a[j+1] {
                a[j], a[j+1] = a[j+1], a[j]
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Bubble Sort (O(n²) time, O(1) space)

    Each pass "bubbles" the next largest element into its final position. Adding an early-exit flag when no swaps occur gives O(n) best case on already-sorted input. Rarely used in practice — prefer insertion sort for small n.
