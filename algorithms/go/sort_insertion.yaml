    Which sorting algorithm …

    - Builds the final array one item at a time
    - Shifts larger elements right to insert the current key
    - Runs in **O(n²)** worst‑case but **O(n)** on nearly‑sorted data?

    What sorting algorithm is this? What is its time and space complexity?

    ```go
    for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
        key := a[i]
        j   := i - 1
        for j >= 0 && a[j] > key {
            a[j+1] = a[j]
            j--
        }
        a[j+1] = key
    }
    ```

    Insertion Sort (O(n²) worst, O(n) best, O(1) space)

    Efficient for small or nearly‑sorted arrays — many real‑world sorts (like Go's `sort.Slice`) switch to insertion sort below ~12 elements. Stable: equal elements keep their original order.
