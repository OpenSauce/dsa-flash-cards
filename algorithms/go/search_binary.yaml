    Which search algorithm …

    - Works on a **sorted** array
    - Repeatedly halves the search interval
    - Runs in **O(log n)** time?

    **Binary Search**

    A search algorithm that halves the search space each step on sorted data, running in O(log n) time. Use whenever you have sorted data and need to find a value or a boundary (lower/upper bound). Trade-off: requires the input to be sorted -- if data changes frequently, maintaining sort order may outweigh the search speedup.

    What search algorithm is this? What is its time complexity?

    ```go
    func binarySearch(a []int, key int) int {
        lo, hi := 0, len(a)-1
        for lo <= hi {
            mid := (lo + hi) / 2
            if a[mid] == key { return mid }
            if a[mid] < key { lo = mid + 1 } else { hi = mid - 1 }
        }
        return -1
    }
    ```

    Binary Search (O(log n))

    Requires a sorted input. Each iteration eliminates half the search space. Watch for the off-by-one pitfall: use `lo <= hi` (not `<`) to avoid missing the last element.
