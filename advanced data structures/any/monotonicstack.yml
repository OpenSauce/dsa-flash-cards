title: "Monotonic Stack"
Front: |
    A data structure used to maintain order of elements that are either only decreasing or increasing.
    This is an efficient method of retriving the next biggest/next smallest value.

    Example:
    <psuedo-code>
    initialize a stack
    iterate over the input array {
      while the stack is not empty and the top value is less than the current array item {
        pop from the stack
      }

      check top to find the next largest
      push our value onto the stack
    }

    There are two important notes: The final value popped was the largest before your item.
    And the top of the stack before you push is the next greatest value.
