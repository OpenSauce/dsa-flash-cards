    Which data structure …

    - Lists **all suffixes of a string in lexicographic order**
    - Enables substring search via binary search in **O(m log n)**
    - Can be built in **O(n log n)** (or O(n) with SA-IS)?

    **Suffix Array**

    A sorted array of all suffixes of a string, enabling substring search via binary search in O(m log n) time. Use for string matching, longest common prefix queries, and problems on large texts where a suffix tree's memory overhead is prohibitive. Trade-off: slower to build than a suffix tree (O(n log n) vs. O(n) for Ukkonen's), but uses significantly less memory and is simpler to implement.

    What operation does this implement, and what is its time complexity?

    ```go
    type pair struct{ rank, idx int }
    sa := make([]int, n)
    for i := range sa { sa[i] = i }
    sort.Slice(sa, func(i, j int) bool {
        return s[sa[i]:] < s[sa[j]:]
    })
    ```

    Build suffix array (naïve) – O(n log² n)

    Sorting all suffixes directly. Each string comparison is O(n), giving O(n² log n) naïvely, but ranking-based approaches reduce to O(n log² n). For large strings, use the SA-IS algorithm for O(n).

    What operation does this implement, and what is its time complexity?

    ```go
    lo, hi := 0, n
    for lo < hi {
        mid := (lo + hi) / 2
        if s[sa[mid]:] < pattern {
            lo = mid + 1
        } else {
            hi = mid
        }
    }
    // check if pattern is prefix of suffix starting at sa[lo]
    ```

    Substring search via suffix array – O(m log n)

    Binary search over the sorted suffix array, comparing the pattern against each suffix prefix. Faster than building a suffix tree when you only need search and the alphabet is large.
